There is no need to drive anywhere and you’ll be right in the center of all the action. Plus, you’ll have an easy stumble to bed after the party! Continental breakfast and a light lunch will be provided on Saturday. Visit the <a href="http://www.campabnaki.org" target="_blank">Camp Abnaki website</a> for more info, photos, and a virtual tour.</p>

Sheets, pillows, and towels will be provided. Cabins are arranged in a village with 6 cabins, a fire pit, and a separate (but conveniently located!) wash house. Each wash house has multiple toilets, sinks, showers, changing areas, and plenty of hot water. The wash houses are much nicer than you’d expect at a camp, recently renovated, and just a few steps away from your cabin. Bring your own toiletries, but we’ll make sure there’s plenty of sunscreen and bug spray available.</p>

Aside from the welcome BBQ on Friday and the reception on Saturday, food will not be provided for off-site guests. Transportation will not be provided, but there is plenty of parking available. We expect anyone staying off site to make safe and responsible decisions.</p>
