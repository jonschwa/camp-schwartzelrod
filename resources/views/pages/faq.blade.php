                                <p><strong>For men:</strong> Jacket and tie not required, but feel free to jazz it up if you want! Jeans aren’t cool, but a tuxedo is overkill.</p>
                                <p><strong>For women:</strong> Wear practical shoes! Avoid shoes with a heel, particularly a stiletto. Flat shoes, boots, or low wedges are your best bet.</p>
