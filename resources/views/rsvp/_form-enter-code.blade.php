            Remember, we will NOT be sending out paper invitations and all RSVPs will be processed through this website.
            We think itâ€™s pretty simple and tested it on some not-so-tech-savvy parents so we hope everyone will give
            it a shot. But if all this newfangled internet technology is really too much to handle, you can click the
            large red button below and we will follow up with you individually.
